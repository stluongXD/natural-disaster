##Project Proposal

##Project Description
We will be working with the Fema Housing assistance data for owners and renters. FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) collected this data and we will be accessing this data through their API. Our target audience are insurance companies who may want to use the information to determine how much they should charge their clients depending on where they live and the frequency disasters occur in that area. 

##Three questions our project will answer areâ€¦
Which area required the most assistance from Fema?
Is there a significant difference in requests between homeowners and renters?
How much money do people usually receive from Fema?

##Technical Description
We will be reading in our data through an API. We will probably need to join different datasets together so that we can have enough information for our project. We may also need to filter the data so that we can specifically narrow down and talk about a specific group of people who were affected by a disaster. Since we are using an API, we will be using the httr and jsonlite. We are not sure if we will need to use a new library for our project yet. We anticipate making 3 different meaningful charts will be a challenge because we are worried that we might not have enough information from our API. 

##Target:
